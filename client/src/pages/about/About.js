        Pear Programmers provides all the status updates and information needed
        to collaborate on a project.

      <p>
        Meetings are a vital tool for improving communication, transparency,
        adaptability, and collaboration among team members. But when developing
        software asynchronously there are times that the well-meaning effort to
        keep everyone updated becomes a continual obligation of providing status
        and check-ins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core purpose of this app is to address this issue while helping to
        foster a strong team dynamic. Pear Programmers provides visibility into
        each team memberâ€™s work and focus for the day, coordinates efforts
        within the team, helps teams identify and address obstacles promptly,
        and results in a fostered sense of shared responsibility and
        accountability while you track your tasks to resolution.
